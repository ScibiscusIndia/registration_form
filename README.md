# Registration_form
A html validated form with payment acceceptance api intigration.

## A flask application
it is a flask application and the form is validated using javascript and data are ahared/transfered using python.
using python I have inserted the data into the database and taking input from the form.
the payment gateway is powered by instamojo api.

## Upcoming updates
1. replacing the payment gateway that takes less convenince charge.
2. adding background image or color in the form.
3. update in payment gateway integration. reson -> no any intermidition, so no commision(advantage->max gp/phonepay payment customer).takes 3 days to my transfer account and commision of Rs 3 + 3% from the payment. So I will be using a diffrent payment API for bank transers and net banking.idea(creating a interface for BHIMUPI by default in the front bench).
